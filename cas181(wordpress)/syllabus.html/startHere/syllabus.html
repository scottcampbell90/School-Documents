<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>Introduces the creation of sophisticated, dynamic, interactive and fully functional websites using WordPress, a Content Management System (CMS). Includes installing and modifying templates, creating efficient site navigation using menus, organizing a site using components, enhancing a site with plugins, creating a blog, and creating user functionality with user logins.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> CAS 111D, CAS 206, and CAS 215; placement into RD 115 and WR 115. Audit available.</p>
<h3>Instructional Approach</h3>
<p>CAS 181W is a beginning class for learning WordPress. This course is arranged chronologically and employs a modular design. Each week, students complete all assignments listed in that week's module. All modules appear in the Content area during the entire course.</p>
<p>Due dates for each week's assignments will be listed on the Course Calendar which is available in the Content area. Assignments within the modules may direct students to use the tools contained in Desire2Learn, including the Dropbox and&nbsp;Discussions. These tools will be accessible both from within the weekly content modules as well as from the course navigation bar.</p>
<p>The Learning modules are listed for each week in the term. When you open the table of contents for each week, you will see a lecture page and an assignment page. Each week's module has assignments from the Knitting website and the Landscaping website. If there is a quiz for that module, the quiz will be listed as well. Discussion questions will appear throughout the course and will have links in the Modules too.</p>
<h3>Communication Guidelines</h3>
<p>Communicate by using the Desire2Learn e-mail system which can be accessed from the course navigation. You can use Desire2Learn e-mail to send a private e-mail to me and/or classmates, which is located in the top right corner of the window.</p>
<p>If your question or comment would be of interest to other students, please post it to the Discussion area for that module. This way other participants can help answer questions, and all participants will benefit from the answers. Please refer to the information on "netiquette" in the introductory module for guidelines governing the content of written communications. Your first communication assignment is to introduce yourself in the discussion topic "Introductions."</p>

<li>Use WordPress software to create personal and/or business websites following current professional and/or industry standards.</li>
<li>Use critical thinking skills to design and create dynamic WordPress websites.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course Prerequisites</h3>

<h3>Participation Expectations</h3>

<h3>Activities, Assignments and Assessments</h3>
<p><b>Assignments</b></p>
<p>Your understanding of the concepts and your ability to work in WordPress will be assessed by the completion of your assignments and an individual project. All assignments must be completed to successfully finish the class. Late assignments will not be accepted with the exception of one "free" late assignment. See the Late Policy for more information on this.</p>
<p><strong>Module Assignments&nbsp;</strong> - Each week you'll work through assignments in the module. One will be from the Yarn Over yarn shop and the other will be from PCC Landscaping, two fictitious sites that were created for this course.</p>
<p><strong>Project&nbsp;</strong> - Your individual project is to design, develop, and publish a website using recommended design practices. Your website will contain a home page and at least four (but no more than 6) pages. You will have two project update deadlines during the term and the project is due during Finals Week. Learn more about the <a href="../final_project/final_project.html" target="_new">Project.</a></p>
<p><strong>Discussion Questions&nbsp;</strong> - There will be discussion questions that you are required to respond to during the course. Links to the discussion questions will be appear in the modules in which they are assigned.</p>
<p>Grades are based on your&nbsp;hands-on assignments, Project, Discussion Questions and Quizzes. Feedback will be given on assignments and grades will be posted within one week after the due date. Be sure to look at the Grades after they have been graded in order to receive feedback.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity (rules about cheating, plagiarism, or sharing work)</h3>
<p>Cheating is against PCC policy. Cheating includes any attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in arriving at an honest grade assessment, and may include copying answers from other students or using unauthorized notes during tests. Plagiarism is a particular form of cheating that involves presenting as one's own the ideas or work of another, and may include using other people's ideas without proper attribution and submitting another person's work as one's own. Violations of the cheating policy will result in a grade of '0' for the assignment in question, and may result in a failing grade for the course at the instructor's discretion. For further information review the institution's <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/pcc/abt/rights/student_rights/integrity.htm">Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, please contact me as soon as possible to make arrangements. Accommodations are not retroactive, but begin when the instructor receives the Approved Academic Accommodations form from the student (this form may be submitted via email). To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a counselor in Disability Services on any PCC campus. Office locations, phone numbers and additional information can be located on the <b>Disability Services website:</b> <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/resources/disability">http://www.pcc.edu/resources/disability</a>.</p>
<h3>Grading Policies</h3>
<p>Students must choose their grading option through MyPCC. Instructors can no longer change the grading options for students. This must be done by the student.</p>
<p>Students can change their grade option through MyPCC up until the end of the eighth week of the term. For example, students can change from Letter Grade to P/NP or from P/NP to Letter Grade up until the end of the eighth week of the term.</p>
<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<p>The grade options above apply to CAS and OS classes. Other PCC classes may have different grade options. Students should check with advisors in other programs on grade options for other PCC classes.</p>
<p>Students who plan to complete a certificate or degree within the Computer Applications and Office Systems program must complete all CAS/OS classes with a C or better letter grade. Classes completed with a Pass grade, other than 1-credit classes, will not be counted towards any CAS/OS certificate or degree.</p>
<h4>Audit Grade</h4>
<p>Students can request an Audit grade for any CAS or OS class up until the end of the first week of the term. They must get instructor permission to choose an Audit grade. Students must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor an e-mail requesting an Audit grade option by 3:00 PM of the first Friday of the term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once an Audit grade is selected, neither students nor instructors can change from an Audit grade to a letter grade or P/NP grade after the end of the second week of the term. (Classes taken for Audit grade cannot be counted toward any certificate or degree program.)</p>
<h4>CIPR and Incomplete Grades</h4>
<p>Only instructors can assign the CIPR or Incomplete grade options. Students cannot choose either of these two grade options. The decision to use CIPR or Incomplete will be based upon individual circumstances and will be entirely up to the instructor to make the decision. For additional information please visit: <a href="http://www.pcc.edu/grades">http://www.pcc.edu/grades</a>.</p>
